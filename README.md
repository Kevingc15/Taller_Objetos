# Taller_Objetos

For the first 3 classes, I created a package called BasicObjects, I edited the classes to have all the private properties 
and only edit them through getters and setters, applying the OOP encapsulation

For the 3 new classes I had to create, create models for a restaurant, where the user, restaurant, and order classes are,
all private properties to use encapsulation.
